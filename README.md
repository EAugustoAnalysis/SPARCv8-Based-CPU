# Sparcv8 Based Project
A CPU project based on the unprivileged version of the SPARCv8 standard:
https://sparc.org/technical-documents/

The aim is sort-of compliance. I doubt I'll achieve it at any point, but I do wish to get pretty close.
There's a lot of SPARC stuff that's ambiguous or left to the direction of the programmer, so I have a lot of wiggle room.
I want to document anything extraneous I produce well, and I want you to be able to run most SPARCv8 instructions and get the expected result.

A bit of a toy project to get me ready for my UMD EE classes.

Currently written in Verilog , but this is part of a 3 step project:
1. Implement SPARCv8 in Verilog
2. Modify SPARCv8 for SystemVerilog
3. Implement SPARCv9 in Systemverilog

This made the most sense to me, as I know both Verilog and SystemVerilog to a reasonable degree, but it's really difficult for me to focus on the code with the kind of freedom SystemVerilog affords me to get lost in typedef land.

# In Progress
Still working on these, I wanted easily doable goals that show my ability to
integrate IP's, create IP's, and utilize sparc features. I want all of these done before the end of my ENEE350 architectures class.

Currently writing:
- Load/Store/Swap/Atomic Load Store
- Trap handling
- TSO compliant memory handler with wishbone
- Block ram and internal rom
- ASR Registers - partially finished, but I plan to add a few features here

Peripherals in progress:
- SPARCv9 style watchdog timer
- SPARCv9 style TICK register - in ASR
- 6 x 7 segment display - Hex, packed into one ASR register
- UART TX/RX - use BRAM buffers, integrate wd5gnr's IP
- PS/2 keyboard input - use BRAM buffers, adapt wd5gnr's UART IP
- SD card - Memory map a few sectors

- Capstone feature - VGA Text mode using block ram based VRAM, and an ASR register to activate

# In testing
(Finished and synthesized but not tested)
- Fetch
- Decode
- Execute (for most instructions)
- Register write (for most instructions)
- Register windows (NWINDOWS=3)
- Compliant ALU with signed and unsigned multiply/divide

Peripherals in testing:
- Error mode indicator LED

# Future plans
(Likely going to be finished after my ENEE350 classe in preparation for my 400 level digital design classes)
- Multi-stage pipeline
- SDRAM usage as main memory, expanded memory handler
- I and D cache as BRAMs
- FPU

Peripherals planned:
- An actual (not space expensive altera blob) divider
- Memory mapped IO, cachable and non-cachable memory (like OpenSPARC)
- More IO interfaces, possible SPI, I2C, GPIO
- Better debugging, some kind of wishbone debug or NIOS interface

__References:__

This project has gone through 5 redesigns, and I started this with zero knowledge of processor design, so I did quite a bit of reading. On top of my ENEE350 class, which has (as of 9/8/2021) taught me a lot already, I have these resources to thank for my philosophies and knowledge. Like all great failed projects, I hope that if mine never goes anywhere it becomes a cool list of references on CPU implementation:
